While there are many online resources for competitive programming, finding a structured data structures and algorithms course can be challenging due to scattered and disorganized content. AlgoZenith's methodical approach and the best DSA course curriculum accelerated my learning significantly. It's noteworthy that Vivek Gupta's teaching in the data structure course exhibits an exceptional level of expertise." ,
